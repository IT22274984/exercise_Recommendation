Personalized Gym Workout Recommendation System üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Overview
This project is a user-friendly web-based Personalized Gym Workout Recommendation System designed to help gym members receive tailored workout plans and dietary suggestions based on their unique fitness goals and preferences. Built using Streamlit, it leverages Content-Based Filtering powered by cosine similarity for generating personalized recommendations and ensures an intuitive user interface for effortless interaction.

Features
User Authentication:

Members can input their unique Member ID to access personalized recommendations.
Validates Member ID and fetches user-specific details.
Personalized Recommendations:

Tailored workout plans and dietary suggestions based on fitness goals and fitness type using Content-Based Filtering.
Top-N recommendations powered by a precomputed cosine similarity matrix.
Content-Based Filtering:

Recommendations are generated by comparing the user's preferences with available workout plans based on encoded attributes like fitness goal, fitness type, and diet plan.
User-Friendly Interaction:

Fitness goals and fitness types are displayed in easy-to-understand labels (e.g., "Weight Loss," "Cardio").
Configurable number of recommendations through an interactive slider.
Feedback Mechanism:

Users can submit feedback directly through the application.
Scalable and Modular Code:

Modularized for easy integration and further development.
Preloaded dataset with encoded fitness attributes for quick computations.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit for an interactive and responsive web application.
Backend: Python for handling recommendation logic and data processing.
Data Processing: Pandas for managing the dataset and preprocessing.
Recommendation Engine: Content-Based Filtering using Cosine Similarity.
Serialization: Pickle for storing preprocessed data and label encoders.
How It Works
The system accepts a Member ID as input.
Based on the ID, it retrieves user details like fitness goals and fitness types from the preloaded dataset.
Using a Content-Based Filtering approach:
The user's preferences are compared with the attributes of all available workout plans.
Cosine Similarity is used to calculate how closely a workout plan matches the user's preferences.
Top-N recommendations are generated and displayed in a user-friendly manner, including:
Fitness Goal
Fitness Type
Exercises
Diet Plan
